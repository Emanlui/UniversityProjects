# Simplex

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Emanlui/Simplex)

Simplex method is a linear programming algorithm that optimize a function with certain restrictions.

# Dependencies
1. Tkinter
2. Numpy 
```
	pip install numpy
```
3. Matplotlib
```
	pip install --user matplotlib
```
4. PIL
```
	pip install Pillow
	python3 -m pip install Pillow
```
5. Fractions
```
	sudo pip install Fraction
```
7. Math

# Input

The input should be a text file (.txt) with the following format:
```bash
-1 2 1 0 0 4
-1 1 0 1 0 12
-1 -3 0 0 1 0
```
Where the last line of the matrix will be the objective function and the other ones above are the restricctions.

# How to run the program?

1. Open the file "simple.py".
2. Open the input file with the matrix you want to resolve.
3. Click on "next" until the program shows you the answer.
